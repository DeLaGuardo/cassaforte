  "Provides facility functions for working with an embedded Cassandra server, which is very useful
   for testing your application without having a C* cluster running and for cases when application
   requires Standalone Cassandra without additional installation.

   In order to work with an embedded cluster, you'll have to have `cassandra-all` dependency in your
   project.clj, for example:

      [org.apache.cassandra/cassandra-all \"2.0.2\"]"
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io])
  (:import [org.apache.cassandra.service CassandraDaemon]
